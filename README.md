# [3D in the Browser With Three.js][published url]
## Instructor: [\Stuart Memo][instructor url]


Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web. Its goal is to simplify the complicated WebGL API.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Stuart Memo will cover everything you need to get up and running with Three.js. You'll see how to set up boilerplate for a Three.js project and you'll get to build a simple projectâ€”a rolling dice animation.


## Source Files Description


The source files for this course consist of a basic HTML file that references the included Three.js and Tween.js libraries. It also contains `main.js` which has the main body of the project source code. To see the animation in action, simply open index.html in a web browser.
